With Dashbuilder you can create dashboards in 3 different ways:

* *Dashbuilder Authoring*: There's a tool to visually author dashboards (drag and drop) which is part of Dashbuilder Authoring;
* *Java*: A Java DSL API allow users to create dashboards using Java and export it to ZIP that can run on Dashbuilder Runtime. See https://blog.kie.org/2021/04/building-dashboards-using-plain-java.html[Building Dashboards Using Plain Java] for more information.
* *YML*: A new https://jesuino.github.io/dashbuilder-client/[experimental tool] allow users to create dashboards with YML and then run on Dashbuilder.
