There are three main ways of creating dashboards and data visualizations with Dashbuilder: *Authoring Tool*, *Java*, and *YAML*.

=== Dashbuilder Authoring
Dashbuilder Authoring is a web application which allows users to create pages using the layout editor, a drag and drop tool. It is available as a container and the result can be downloaded in ZIP format. It has three screens only: *Pages*, *DataSets* and *Export/Import*.

=== Java API
There's a https://blog.kie.org/2021/04/building-dashboards-using-plain-java.html[Java API] to create and export Dashboards to ZIP format. It exposes the internal API in a DSL-ish API. The greatest advantage of using the Java API is that you can grab data to build static datasets, making high performance data visualizations integrated to Dashbuilder Runtime, which we will talk about later.
Currently it only exports to ZIP, but it is our roadmap for a new Java DSL that will export YAML dashboards.

                                    .row("United States", "331002651")
                                    .row("Indonesia", "273523615")
                                    .row("Pakistan", "220892340")
                                    .row("Brazil", "212559417")

                                    .row("Russia", "145934462")
                                    .row("Mexico", "128932753")
                                    .buildDataSet();
                                    
// a bar chart configuration that is used to visualize the data set
var popBarChart = newBarChartSettings().subType_Column()
                                        .width(800)
                                        .height(600)
                                        .dataset(dataSet)
                                        .column("Country")
                                        .column("Population")
                                        .buildSettings();
// a page with a HTML header and the displayer that uses the bar chart configuration                                               
var page = page("Countries Population",
                row("<h3> Countries Population</h3>"),
                row(displayer(popBarChart)));

// finally exports the dashboard to a local ZIP file
DashboardExporter.get().export(dashboard(asList(page)),
                                "population.zip",
                                ExportType.ZIP);

=== YAML and JSON
The most recent addition to Dashbuilder is the possibility to live load JSON and YAML dashboards. Different from the export ZIP dashboard, this new way of creating dashboards can be used in a client-only Dashbuilder installation accessing JSON datasets. You can try it in an https://jesuino.github.io/dashbuilder-client/[online editor], which is also used to visualize the dashboards. A new YAML editor based on Monaco is in the roadmap.
